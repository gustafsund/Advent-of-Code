# Advent of Code 

## Advent of Code 2020
Some solutions to problems from Advent of Code 2020. Was written on Windows, in Spyder using Anacondas, hence some messy file paths and "#%%" section delimiters native to Spyder. Didn't fulfill as this was during a period of heavy course work. 

## Advent of Code 2021
Solutions to this year's AOC were done in Notebook format.
